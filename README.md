# Fork Details
------

> This fork exists to improve OP performance and convenience for GM cars, specifically the Chevy Volt.
> I started because the kegman fork wouldn't run on Comma Three, and the result is the best Volt driving experience in the known universe.

> While most of the features in this fork are my original implementations, none of it would have been possible without the work of others in the community, which is often my starting point or inspiration, and nearly always a reference.
> I reference code/concepts to their original authors to the best of my knowledge.
> Feel free to let me know if I have missed or mistaken a reference.

> **Pleae provide any positive/negative feedback on Patreon or the comma/openpilot/retropilot Discord servers, especially if you'd like your issues addressed.**

#### Current Fork Features [✅ = optional via toggle]:
-----

**Running on move-fast fork of openpilot v0.8.9**, which adds:

* Vision and/or map-based slowing down for curves
* Map-based automatic changing of speed limit (with optional offset)
  * **Map-based slowing for curves and automatic setting of speed requires a data connection**
  * You can subscribe to [comma Prime](https://comma.ai/prime), which is a great service and is totally worth the cost, or you can use your own hotspot and enable the "disable onroad uploads" toggle (see below) to only use data for these features
* ~~Hands on wheel monitoring~~ *In stock*
* ~~Disable disengage when gas pressed~~ *Now in stock*

**Additional fork features:**

- [x] Running old but proud openpilot 0.8.12 lateral and 0.8.10 driver monitoring models
- [x] [Comma3] AGNOS4 OS
- [x] [Volt/Acadia] Alternate lateral (steering) tunes using the new "torque" controller
- [Volt] Much improved steering control over stock (working on upstreaming)
- [x] [Volt 2017] Auto-resume behind stopped lead car as they pull away; a.k.a. stop and go (ported from kegman)
- [x] [Volt 2018] Auto-creep behind stopped lead car as they pull away (tap gas or resume button to resume)
- [x] [GM] [✅] AutoHold (autohold brakes when stopped; ported from kegman)
- [x] [GM] Adjustable follow "mode" using ACC distance button (ported from kegman, but smoother follow profiles)
- [x] [✅] Adjustable lane position using onscreen buttons
    * Tap buttons to change lane position for 1/3 mile; double-tap to change for 10 miles
    * Tap again to go back to center position
- [x] Automatic lane position: if in right lane, assume right position, or left position if in left lane.
    * To activate, enable adjustable lane position, then while onroad, tap left then right (or right then left) lane position button within 2s.
    * Tap either button to deactivate
    * Requires clear lanelines, and a straight road
- [x] [GM] [✅] Dynamic follow mode
- [x] [GM] Toggle steering with LKAS button (wheel color changes to indicate disengagement)
- [x] [GM] One-pedal driving a.k.a. autosteering only a.k.a. toggle longitudinal control: using regen (volt) and/or light/moderate/heavy braking, control OP all the way to a stop, without a lead, and without disengaging, with just the gas pedal (see below) (application of friction brakes originally suggested by cybertronicify — 10/06/2021)
- [x] [✅] [Dynamic Lane Profile](https://github.com/sunnyhaibin/openpilot#dynamic-lane-profile-dlp) (DLP); *tap button while driving to switch between auto/laneless/lane-only. must enable "Disable use of lanelines" for button to appear* (ported from sunnyhaibin)
- [x] [✅] Normal/sport/eco acceleration modes [cycle with on-screen button] (adapted from kegman implementation)
    * Eco mode is great for
      * the environment (you pig),
      * not over-accelerating behind a jumpy lead in traffic, and 
      * softer acceleration when exiting curves (if curve braking is enabled).
- [x] [✅] 1/5 mph changes for tap/hold of the inc/dec buttons (ported from Spector56; different from that of newer stock OP)
- [x] [✅] 3mph cruise speed offset: speed will be 23/28/33/38/etc.
- [x] [✅] Alternate sound effect set (inspired by sunnyhaibin implementation of mute sounds)
- [x] [✅] Mute engage and disengage sounds (inspired by sunnyhaibin implementation)
- [x] Brightness control: Tap driver monitoring icon to cycle stock/medium/low brightness (most recently suggested by veryluckyguy)
    * Screen will temporarily undim for warning/critical alerts
- [x] [✅] Disable onroad uploads: for use with data-limited wifi hotspots. Reduces data use from 400MB/hour or 22MB/mile (based on 30 minute low-speed trip) down to 25MB/hour or 0.4MB/mile (based on 5 hour trip at 84mph; i.e. not a perfect comparison to the other trip)
    * Don't bother if you subscribe to [comma Prime](https://comma.ai/prime), which has unlimited data, and a host of other benefits! Don't delay; subscribe today!!
    * iPhone users can use [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7f3c7e98f95d4f85a9bad939aa069fcd) to instantly open the personal hotspot page in the Settings app in order to enable personal hotspot for your comma device to connect.
      * Combined with an Automation to run the shortcut when you enter CarPlay, or when you connect to your car's Bluetooth, this can be a pretty convenience setup.
    * Android users could try the [Hot Spot Starter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.thjunge11.autohotspot) app, but I can't recommend it as I haven't tried it, so maybe [look for something else if it doesn't work](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/enable-hotspot-automatically-when-i-enter-the-car.3915107/)
- [x] [✅] Coasting: OP will still brake behind a lead car and to slow down for curves, but will not apply engine/regen/friction brakes in order to keep the set speed (by user or map speed limit)
    * Toggle coasting while driving 
      * in Volt using gear shifter: D for coasting, L for regen (thanks to jshuler for discovering the CAN message of extra gear shifter values)
      * in other cars by tapping the max speed indicator
    * A "+" after the max speed indicates that coasting is enabled
    * *Can be a bit rough on the brakes when following downhill over set speed; recommend to disable if uncomfortable when constantly following downhill*
    * (Inspired by the implementation in sunnyhaibin's fork)
- [x] [✅] Brake when 15% over set speed when coasting enabled
- [x] [Volt] [✅] Coasting D/L control: Tie the above option to the D/L gear shifter position. Coast in D; maintain set speed exactly in L.
- [x] [✅] Nudgeless lane change: OP will start lane change automatically in direction of blinker after blinker on for 3s
- [x] [✅] Braking indicator shows level of regenerative/engine and friction braking
- [x] **Customizable, dynamic vehicle/device metrics** (adapted from kegman)
    * To use:
        * Tap the current speed on the openpilot display to cycle the number of metrics
        * Tap any metric to cycle its content (sorry for all the god-forsaken tapping, a better metric display with vehicle, following, position, and device widgets is a WIP)
    * Metrics (35 to choose from):
        * Device info: CPU temperature (°C and °F), CPU percent, CPU temp + percent (°C and °F), memory temperature (°C and °F), memory used, free storage, ambient temperature (°C and °F), fanspeed (as percent of max), GPS accuracy (and number of satelites), altitude
        * Vehicle info: Engine RPM, engine coolant temperature (°C and °F), engine RPM + coolant temperature (°C and °F), steering torque, steering angle, desired steering angle, vehicle acceleration, vehicle jerk, percent grade of current road (one based on GPS, one based on device accelerometer), Volt high-voltage battery wattage [kW], voltage [V], current [A], and voltage+wattage 
        * Lead-following info: follow distance level, lead distance [length], desired lead distance [length], lead distance [time], desired lead distance [time], follow distance and acceleration mpc costs [in units of the stock OP costs; i.e. 2.5 means 2.5× the stock OP value], relative lead velocity, absolute lead velocity
- [x] [GM] [✅] **One-pedal driving**: OP will apply light to heavy braking when you let completely off the gas, allowing you to come to a full stop and resume without OP disengaging
    * **Not necessary to enable the one-pedal toggle; you engage/disengage while driving**
    * Engage in three ways
      1. While cruise is set, press and hold the follow distance button for 0.5s (continue to hold for immediate hard braking if necessary)
      2. If one-pedal engage on gas toggle is enabled, press gas while cruise is set and traveling above 1mph
      3. While cruise is set, lower cruise speed to 1
    * When in one-pedal mode, the max speed indicator in openpilot will be replaced with a one-pedal mode indicator. Tap the one-pedal icon to toggle one-pedal engage on gas mode
    * Vehicle follow distance indicator and pedal icon color indicate the one-pedal braking profile in use; 1 bar/2 bar/3 bar = (⚫️)/🟢/🟠/🔴 = (regen-engine)/light/moderate/heavy braking
    * Control braking with follow distance button:
      * *Single press*: alternate between persistent light or moderate 🟢/🟠 braking
      * *Press and hold*: apply temporary hard braking 🔴 (Chevy's the ones that decided a brake paddle on the steering wheel was a good idea; not me)
      * *Press when friction braking disabled*: activate friction braking 🟢
      * *Double-press when stopped or when gas is pressed and friction braking is active*: deactivate friction braking/activate regen/engine braking ⚫️
    * [Volt] Coasting: using gear shifter, select D for coasting or L for regen (thanks to jshuler)
    * When one-pedal mode active and blinker is on below 20mph, autosteer will automatically pause
      * [Optional; tap wheel icon to toggle while in one-pedal mode]
      * A second white circle around the wheel icon indicates autosteer pause is enabled
    * *Must have disable disengage on gas toggle enabled*
- [x] [Volt] [✅] One-pedal D/L coasting: In one-pedal regen/engine ⚫️ braking mode in D, no braking whatsoever will be applied. Shift to L for max regen. Happy hypermiling!
- [x] [GM] [✅] One-pedal engage on gas: When cruising at speed and the driver presses the gas (i.e. not when resuming from a stop), engage one-pedal mode
    * Toggle while one-pedal mode enabled by tapping the pedal icon
    * Indiated by an extra circle around one-pedal icon
- [x] [Volt] [✅] One-pedal D/L engage on gas: tie the engage on gas setting to the D/L gear shifter position. Off in D; on in L. (suggested by Shadowlight5)
- [x] [GM] panda-based GM steering fault fix (thanks jshuler)
- [x] Remember last follow mode (ported from kegman)
- [x] Grey/White panda support

### Supported Hardware
------

This fork is developed and used on a Comma Three in a 2018 Chevy Volt, and is also *known* to work on Comma Two and Comma Zero, and in 2017 Volt, 2018 Acadia, and supported Escalades.

### Installation Instructions
------

#### Easy: using sshane's [openpilot-installer-generator](https://github.com/sshane/openpilot-installer-generator)

Use [these instructions](https://github.com/sshane/openpilot-installer-generator#usage) and the following url:
`https://smiskol.com/fork/twilsonco`

Or use Comma's installer the same way: `https://www.installer.comma.ai/twilsonco`


To ride the bleeding edge, try the staging branch where new features are tested before they go to regular users:
(Be extra diligent and attentive when using the staging branch; it is considered experimental moreso than the regular branch!)
`https://smiskol.com/fork/twilsonco/tw-0.8.9-staging`

#### Less easy

With a stock installation of OpenPilot confirmed working, SSH into device and run the following:

`cd /data;mv openpilot openpilot_stock;git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/twilsonco/openpilot`

Then, `sudo reboot`

### Automatic Updates
------

This fork will auto-update while your device has internet access, and changes are automatically applied the next time the device restarts.
If you're device stays connected to your car all the time, you'll be presented with a message to update when your car is off.

### Tuning
------

* Remember to make small adjustments to 1 value at a time and then test.
* Use [PlotJugger](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/tools/plotjuggler) to make sure you are going in the right direction.

#### Lateral Tuning
------
**Note**: All of these parameters interact with each other so finding the balance is a bit experimental.

* **Kp too high** - The vehicle overshoots and undershoots center.
* **Kp too low** - The vehicle doesn't turn enough.

* **Ki too high** - The vehicle gets to center without oscillations, but it takes too long to center. If you hit a bump or give the wheel a quick nudge, it should oscillate 3 - 5 times before coming to steady-state. If the wheel oscillates forever (critically damped), then your Kp or Ki or both are too high.
* **Ki too low** - The vehicle oscillates trying to reach the center.

* **steerRatio too high** - The vehicle ping pongs on straights and turns. If you're on a turn and the wheel is oversteering and then correcting, steerRatio is too high, and it's fighting with Kp and Ki (which you don't want) - although in the past it has been observed having an oscillating oversteering tune which could do tighter turns, but the turns weren't pleasant.

* **steerRatio too low** - The vehicle doesn't turn enough on curves.

* **Kf** - Lower this if your car oscillates and you've done everything else. It can be lowered to 0.

What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models and model years](docs/CARS.md). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).

Running in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things
* This software. It's free and available right here.
* One of [the 140+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md). We support Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan, Kia, Chrysler, Lexus, Acura, Audi, VW, and more. If your car is not supported, but has adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist, it's likely able to run openpilot.
* A supported device to run this software. This can be a [comma two](https://comma.ai/shop/products/two), [comma three](https://comma.ai/shop/products/three), or if you like to experiment, a [Ubuntu computer with webcams](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/tools/webcam).
* A way to connect to your car. With a comma two or three, you need only a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/car-harness). With an EON Gold or PC, you also need a [black panda](https://comma.ai/shop/products/panda).

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup).

Running on PC
------

All of openpilot's services can run as normal on a PC, even without special hardware or a car. To develop or experiment with openpilot you can run openpilot on recorded or simulated data.

With openpilot's tools you can plot logs, replay drives and watch the full-res camera streams. See [the tools README](tools/README.md) for more information.

You can also run openpilot in simulation [with the CARLA simulator](tools/sim/README.md). This allows openpilot to drive around a virtual car on your Ubuntu machine. The whole setup should only take a few minutes, but does require a decent GPU.


Community and Contributing
------

openpilot is developed by [comma](https://comma.ai/) and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on [GitHub](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot). Bug fixes and new car ports are encouraged. Check out [the contributing docs](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Documentation related to openpilot development can be found on [docs.comma.ai](https://docs.comma.ai). Information about running openpilot (e.g. FAQ, fingerprinting, troubleshooting, custom forks, community hardware) should go on the [wiki](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki).

You can add support for your car by following guides we have written for [Brand](https://blog.comma.ai/how-to-write-a-car-port-for-openpilot/) and [Model](https://blog.comma.ai/openpilot-port-guide-for-toyota-models/) ports. Generally, a car with adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist is a good candidate. [Join our Discord](https://discord.comma.ai) to discuss car ports: most car makes have a dedicated channel.

Want to get paid to work on openpilot? [comma is hiring](https://comma.ai/jobs/).

And [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/comma_ai).

User Data and comma Account
------

By default, openpilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data through [comma connect](https://connect.comma.ai/). We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

openpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.

openpilot logs the road facing cameras, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.

By using openpilot, you agree to [our Privacy Policy](https://comma.ai/privacy). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma for the use of this data.

Safety and Testing
----

* openpilot observes ISO26262 guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) for more details.
* openpilot has software in the loop [tests](.github/workflows/selfdrive_tests.yaml) that run on every commit.
* The code enforcing the safety model lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software in the loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware in the loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware in the loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 comma devices continuously replaying routes.
