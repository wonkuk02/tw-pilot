Version 0.8.9-tw-3.4 (2021-10-31)
========================
 Happy Halloween!
 * Revamped safety layer for avoiding collisions between coasting/one-pedal mode and braking when following lead, that reverts to stock longitidunal behavior for/when:
   1. Repidly approaching lead
   2. Slow/stopped lead
   3. Very close lead
   4. Low time to collision (i.e. rapidly approaching close lead)
   5. Following at less than target follow distance
 * Add time to collision (ttc) ui metric
 * Use moving average percent grade for smoother reading

Version 0.8.9-tw-3.3 (2021-10-29)
========================
 * lockout of coasting logic is now based on absolute and relative lead velocity. 
   * Start phasing out my coasting/one-pedal logic for lead approaching at 5mph+, completely returning to stock logic by 12mph+ (i.e. for a lead approaching at more than 12mph, coasting/one-pedal logic is entirely skipped over). 
   * Similar for absolute lead v, phasing out coast/one-pedal for lead driving less than 8mph, and completely locked out for lead speed less than 4mph. So when approaching a stopped lead, stock logic is in use. 
   * However, with one-pedal mode, the greater of one-pedal or cruise braking is applied, and if pro-braking is enabled, this continues to block ALL OP other braking.
 * TESTERS:
   * Please continue to play around with coasting and lead following.
   * Like to know if this is shippable to main branch with followup tuning or if problems need to be resolved beforehand.


Version 0.8.9-tw-3.2 (2021-10-29)
========================
 * disabling lockout of coasting logic after non-cruise braking is used. Was resulting in oscillations when over set speed. Please try following over set speed with coasting enabled to see what the behavior is. Concerned it may be too jerky and that the lead mpc braking will be too quickly applied/removed.

Version 0.8.9-tw-3.1 (2021-10-28)
========================
 * + fixing one-pedal distance-button engagement behavior to alwasy use regen/engine braking when you first engage
 * + coasting ring around brake indicator is more apparent
 * TESTERS: Lots of changes here in behavior and user interface.
   * I'd like more feedback on follow profiles; my driving doesn't include enough weird situations
   * The revamped coasting (with over-speed braking enabled) is a really cool feature, but only if it feels ok once OP starts applying brakes. I need feedback on how this actually performs. If it's dangerous I'll remove the feature from the fork until a proper mpc-based solution is complete
 1. Coasting means coasting! Before, the coasting toggle was merely disabling OP friction braking for maintaining set cruise speed. Now coasting really means coasting. If brake indicator enabled, then when coasting is enabled a circle will show around the brake indicator icon.
   1. Enable the over-speed braking toggle so that OP will start applying regen/engine braking when 9-11mph over set speed, and friction braking 12+ over
   2. Toggle coasting while driving by tapping the brake indicator icon
   3. You cannot disable coasting while driving above set speed unless engine/regen braking toggle is enabled
 2. Engine/regen braking toggle does what the coasting toggle used to do, disables OP friction braking for maintaining set cruise speed
 3. One-pedal mode changes
   1. Now only requires the "Disable disengage on gas" toggle be enabled
   2. One-pedal mode toggle does not need to be on! You toggle it while driving.
   3. One-pedal mode can now be engaged in three ways:
     1. While cruise is set, press and hold the follow distance button for 0.5s (continue to hold for immediate hard braking if necessary)
     2. If one-pedal engage on gas toggle is enabled, press gas while cruise is set and traveling above 1mph
     3. While cruise is set, lower cruise speed to 1
   4. Adjust braking intensity while one-pedal mode is active by pressing follow distance button to toggle light/moderate braking, or holding for heavy braking
   5. Toggle friction/engine/regen braking in two ways:
     1. Double-press follow distance button while gas is pressed to disable friction braking, or single press it while friction braking is disabled to reenable it
     2. Tap the pedal icon on your device screen
 4. Smoother following when at med/far distance behind lead car, despite the follow profile but especially smoother for far follow, thanks to dynamic acceleration costing
 5. Slightly more aggressive braking when approaching very slow/stopped lead car for med/far follow profiles
 6. Stronger positive acceleration (hopefully), especially in sport mode
 

Version 0.8.9-tw-2 (2021-10-22)
========================
 * TESTERS: The big changes are for follow profiles.
   * Please test out following with all three profiles and make observations.
   * My goal with follow profiles is that it feels like having three different people drive the car; all competent and skilled, but with different styles.
   * I want you to think up a character for each follow profile and put yourself in their shoes.
   * That in mind, do the profiles feel right? 
     * Is far follow using it's extra room to smooth out the ride but also comfortably braking in time for a much slower lead?
     * Is close follow close enough to make you a bit uncomfortable but confidently glued to the lead such that you're not uncomfortable?
     * Is medium follow driving the way you picture people driving in Neutropolis, the capital city of the Neutral Planet, home of the Neutrals?
 1. When in one-pedal mode, press resume to resume cruise at the speed you were going before entering one-pedal mode
 2. Smoother follow response thanks to reimplemented dynamic follow distance cost (thanks doug!)
 3. For medium/far follow profiles, proper long-distance braking for rapidly approaching (i.e. stopped or very slow) lead
 4. Smoother following close to lead using any follow profile

Version 0.8.9-tw-1 (2021-10-20)
